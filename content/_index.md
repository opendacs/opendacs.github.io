Welcome to openDACs! Our aim to provide simple-to-follow instructions on how to build reliable precision electronics using off-the-shelf components. This site is not intended for electronics experts; rather, we hope to assist nonexperts working in materials science, condensed matter physics, and other fields in meeting their electronics needs at an economical priceâ€“with respect both to time and money. The main platforms we will use are the versatile Arduino series of microcontrollers and evaluation boards available from Analog Devices.
