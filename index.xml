      <description>Assembly instructions Schematics Eval boards Some AD5764 eval boards have J21 unpopulated. If you encountered this, solder a 14-pin header to the AD5764 eval board so the Arduino can communicate with the AD5764 via SPI.
The AD5764 eval board has 14 jumpers that set various options on the board. Refer to the datasheet for a complete description. For the DAC-ADC, set the jumpers like as follows:
   Jumper # State     LK1 B   Lk2 C   LK3 Inserted   LK4 B   LK5 A and B   LK6 Inserted   LK7 A   LK8 B   LK9 B   LK10 Removed   LK11 A   LK12 Inserted   LK13 Inserted   LK14 Inserted    Similarly, the AD7734 eval board has 30 jumpers that set various options on the board.</description>

      <description>Assembly instructions Prepare the AD9854 Board The original evaluation board from analog devices is no longer sold, instead we buy boards from amazon or ebay, that could be found by searching for ad9854. The boards look like this: to use this board you first need to make sure that pin 70 &amp;ldquo;S/P Select&amp;rdquo; is set to serial programming mode (LOW), 
To do this, take off the heatsink and expose the AD9854 chip (left), using a razor blade break the pin (right) Set the Timer W1 Jumper into the left most position: Remove the resistor R1 from the board and replace the capacitor C3 with a short (0 Ohm SMD resistor).</description>

      <description>Welcome to openDACs! Our aim to provide simple-to-follow instructions on how to build reliable precision electronics using off-the-shelf components. This site is not intended for electronics experts; rather, we hope to assist nonexperts working in materials science, condensed matter physics, and other fields in meeting their electronics needs at an economical priceâ€“with respect both to time and money. The main platforms we will use are the versatile Arduino series of microcontrollers and evaluation boards available from Analog Devices.</description>
